### Pigeon BnB

This project was developed in 1 week by a team of 4 at the Le Wagon. The goal was to create a website like Airbnb, but where we could list anything. We went ahead with renting pigeons. The users can book pigeons specialized in several areas to make their lives better. They can also list their own pigeons for rent. 

The next steps on this project are to clean up the code (since it was an intense week and we were still learning, it will be good to review and clean) and improve some frontend elements (e.g. search bar, cards).
